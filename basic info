The Shopping cart is mainly useful for those who haven’t time to go to shopping, 
those are just entered into this website and bought what ever they want. Even it is 
night or morning they entered into this site, and chosen different items like fruits, 
books, toys etc. ‘Customer is our god’ mainly this website is based on this formula. 
After chosen items he bought into paying process. Customer is happily shopping at 
his rest place.
Online shopping Cart is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or 
services from a seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the 
Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. An online shop, eshop, e-store, 
internet shop, webshop, online store, or virtual store evokes the physical analogy of 
buying products or services at a bricks-and-mortar retailer or in a shopping centre. 
The process is called Business-to-Consumer (B2C) online shopping
In our project we have coded in a such a manner so that the user can see the 
products available in the shopping complex, add them to his cart while adding 
he/she can view the cart and his current total bill at last he would also have the 
option for payment. During payment when the customer will enter the payment 
amount he would be giving to person on bill counter , then that person who is on 
bill counter would be able to see change amount he would be required to give to 
the customer.
For this project we have used:
1) Hashing (unordered map)
2) Vectors
3) Linear Search Algorithm
4)String
5)OOPS
6)STL (in vectors)
