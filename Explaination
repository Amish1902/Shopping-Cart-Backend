Firstly, we have added c++ code to display current date and time in our BILL 
COUNTER.
Then customer name is asked by the system.
After that while loop will continue until the customer checkouts the cart.
After that customers would be getting 3 options:
1)add item 
2)view cart
3)checkout
If the customer enters a to add item then number of products will be displayed 
which are stored in the allProducts vector then the person will select the product 
from the available products.
The selected product will be then added to hash table where id of product is used 
as key and its name as the value of key.
While adding the products to his cart the customer can also view the cart .If the 
cart is empty then cart is empty message is displayed but if the cart has items then 
we will traverse accross hashtable to view product for traversing across cart we 
will use items hashtable and there we will only retrieve the value i.e. product name 
so for that itempair.second is used.
Atlast, we will checkout the cart by paying our bill , through cart class we will get 
our total bill and through checkout function we will be able to pay and exit the cart 
successfully.
